Welcome to the our Shortest Path project!

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

In `src` folder:

- `App.Java`: the main file of the project that directs user to run programs and key in inputs
- `SymbolGraph.java`: the class that builds the Symbol Graph
- `Dijkstra.java`: the class that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest path
- `SymbolGraphTest`: the automated tests that run and check methord in SymbolGraph.java
